## RSA Factoring
RSA is the most widely used public-key cryptography algorithm in the world. It is also one of the most secure, with only a few known attacks.
The RSA algorithm is a public-key cryptosystem. This means that there are two keys, a public key, and a private key. The public key can be known by everyone and is used for encryption. The private key is known only by the owner and is used for decryption. The RSA algorithm is asymmetric, which means that the encryption and decryption keys are different.

The RSA algorithm is based on the fact that it is very difficult to factorize large numbers. The security of the RSA algorithm, therefore, depends on the fact that the factorization of large numbers is a difficult problem.
